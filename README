Shucker
=======

Shucker takes any (X)HTML and gives you back a stripped down version. You
can give it any web page and it will find the actual content of the page,
minus styling, scripts, headers, footers, navigation elements and so on.
Or you can just give it a bit of (X)HTML (like a blog comment) and it will
remove anything `bad'. Shucker always returns valid markup, even if you
give it invalid markup.

  Usage
  -----
  
  Standard usage:
  
    import shucker
    html = '''
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Someone's Webpage</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="header">
          <h1>Someone's Website</h1>
        </div>
        <div id="content">
          <h2>Someone's Webpage!</h2>
      
          <p style="color: #f00;" align=CENTER>This is a paragraph.</p>
      
          <!-- This comment will be stripped. -->
      
          <table><tr><td>
            <p>Click this <a href="javascript:alert('evil');">innocent</a>
            link.</td></p>
          </td></tr></table>
        </div>
        <div id="footer">
          <p>This web page was created by Nyoob Ekid on 1 Feb 2003.</p>
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>'''
    html = shucker.shuck(html)
  
  This example will result in this:
  
    <div> <h2>Someone's Webpage!</h2> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> <div>
    <p>Click this <a>innocent</a> link.</p></div> </div>
  
  Limitations
  -----------
  
  Shucker will usually do a pretty good job, but it may have trouble with
  some pages:
  
    * Shucker does best with semantic markup. Table-based layouts, for
      example, are harder to work with (it still does a fairly good job,
      though).
  
    * Shucker looks for non-text content (headers, footers and navigation
      elements) by looking for `suspicious' <div> elements. It often misses
      things, and it may even mistakenly remove something that is actually
      part of the page.

Enjoy.
