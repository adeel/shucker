this will take an HTML document and give you a printer-friendly version.

it strips styles, scripts and other presentational tags and attributes.  it
also attemps to remove any headers, footers and navigation elements.  it
also turns table cells into div's, with sometimes disastrous results.  it's an
HTML sanitizer written for a very specific purpose (making ugly web pages look
good in print).  i should write a web interface to it.

here's an example.

    import shucker
    html = '''
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Someone's Webpage</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="header">
          <h1>Someone's Website</h1>
        </div>
        <div id="content">
          <h2>Someone's Webpage!</h2>

          <p style="color: #f00;" align=CENTER>This is a paragraph.</p>

          <!-- This comment will be stripped. -->

          <table><tr><td>
            <p>Click this <a href="javascript:alert('evil');">innocent</a>
            link.</td></p>
          </td></tr></table>
        </div>
        <div id="footer">
          <p>This web page was last modified on 1 Feb 2003.</p>
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>'''
    html = shucker.shuck(html)
    print html
    # this will print:
    # <div> <h2>Someone's Webpage!</h2> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> <div><div>
    # <p>Click this <a>innocent</a> link.</p></div> </div> </div>
